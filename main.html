	<h1>Time Â  
 and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to how long an algorithm takes to run based on the input size. A more efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity. Some common time complexities include O(n), O(n^2), and O(log n).</p>

    <p>Space complexity measures how much memory an algorithm uses based on the input size. It's often expressed in terms of the Big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means it requires memory proportional to the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> can be a crucial factor in determining an algorithm's suitability for large datasets.</p>
